# PyBer Analysis Challenge 
Matplotlib


# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the total fare per city type between the months of January and April of 2019. The line graph will display a full comparison between all the city types and assist with decision-makers with solutions. 


# Results

After a complete analysis of all the data that has been combined. Below you can see that total amount of fares between the months of January and April. 
As visualized, you can see that urban areas have the highest total amount of fares during this time period, followed by suburban and rural areas. The line graph can demonstrate the gaps between the city types and how the fares are consistent withinn the first 4 months
