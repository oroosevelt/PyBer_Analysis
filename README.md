# **Overview**

The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the total fare per city type between the months of January and April of 2019. The line graph will display a full comparison between all the city types and assist with decision-makers with solutions. 


# **Results**

After a complete analysis of all the data that has been combined. Below you can see that total amount of fares between the months of January and April. 
As visualized, you can see that urban areas have the highest total amount of fares during this period, followed by suburban and rural areas. The line graph will demonstrate the gaps between the city types and how the fares are consistent within the first 4 months of the year.

Below you can see the compiled data describing in detail the different city types and how they differ. As the data correlates with the line graph above, you can see that urban areas count for majority of the total rides, drivers, and fares, but have the least number of average fares per ride and drivers. 
Although, urban areas can count for majority on the contribution to the data collected, it is rural areas that have the highest average fares per ride and driver. For those who may not be sure, rural areas are swath lands that have few homes and buildings. That definition alone can explain for the minimal number of drivers and rides accounted for in those areas. However, the average amount of fares received per drivers and per rides are exceeding high than the other city types. Rural areas make up about 5.3% of total rides and bring in 6.8% of the total fares.

Urban areas on the contrary, contribute 68.4% of the rides and 62.7% of the total fares, more than both suburban and rural combined. Although they take account for more than half, they have the lowest average fares per ride and per driver which is an estimated 30%, assuming if not all rides acquire long distances compared to the other city types. 
The table below will provide you clear representation of the different factors that contribute to this data.

# **Summary** 
## _Recommendations_

After our analyzation, we have found the 3 following recommendations listed below that best suits the company.

  1) Conduct a study a to see if there is a need for hiring more drivers in rural areas. There is a lack of accessibilities of drivers, we may need to uncover what the reason is. This study may determine help us all arrive to a conclusion that will help us determine if we need to expand and focus more on rural areas. 
  2) Analyze the data for the entirety of the year and look for trends. Compare last yearâ€™s data with the current years to see the variations in data and how that can project future cost, expenses, income, and onboarding 
  3) If we find in our study as mentioned in previously, that there is a need for rides and drivers, we should consider setting up a base near those areas and that will create more job opportunities as well as ease of accessibilities for the customers.
